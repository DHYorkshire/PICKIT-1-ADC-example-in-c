# PICKIT-1-ADC-example-in-c
Updaded vertion of the cADC program by Myke Predko (123 PIC microcontroller experiments for the evil genius) to run on MPLAB IDC v8.92 and HI-TECH C V9.81 (Lite mode)
Mype Preddko's book "123 PIC microcontroller experments for the evil genius published in 2005 was one of the best starting points to learn PIC programming based around the 16F684.
This program drawn from the book has been compiled and uploaded to a PICKIT-1 (using the 16F684) using MPLABs IDC v8.92 and the HI-TECH C v9.81 (Windows 10)
Thease are the updated versions of the software ordginally suppied free with PIC chip, and still can be found as legacy downloads.
This has been supplied here to help anybody with a PICKIT-1 to test the board
